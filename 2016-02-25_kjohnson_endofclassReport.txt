Accomplished in class:
Got SDL and nanotree working from flashdrive ubuntu, which has also solved the barrier I was running into on my home linux machine. Took first steps in implementing openmp into nanopond: made safe variables for random number generation and buffer.

Current goals:
Attempt to optimize nearest neighbor function.
See if making instructions in genome byte addressable is faster.
Take first steps in extracting data from dumps and analyzing with R.
Identify bottlenecks.

Implement openmp, so each thread picks a random cell and runs concurrently
	Run metric analysis at each step to identify potential performance gains.
